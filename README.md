# Complaint Escalation System

Basically, I just want to automate a complaint by sending an email or a message through various channels.
The message will be sent regularly. The interval is configurable. There is a choice to set backoff time.
The text is auto-generated by AI with a template as the anchor point, so the generated text will still have the same meaning.


### Config

### Deploy
- Deploy the service on the Heroku
